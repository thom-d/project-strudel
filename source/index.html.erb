      <p> This is the ultimate UX resource if you’re planning a project or want to know what we do. Each project has its own unique challenges, and as such, each project will have it’s own path and project plan. One-size-fits-all is not the case in the user experience world. This is why we recommend reading through the playbook and learning about design thinking before applying foundations. </p>
